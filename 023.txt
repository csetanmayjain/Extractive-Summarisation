In this particular geography getting permission to dig the ground and lay the pipes is a bit of a task," said Mr R. Sridharan, vice president of networks at Tata.
The laser bridges can route data at speeds up to 1.25gbps (2,000 times faster than a 512kbps broadband connection) but Tata is running its hardware at more modest speeds of 1-2mbps.
This has led Chennai-based Tata to turn to equipment that uses lasers to make the final mile leap between Tata's core network and the premises of customers.
Lasers help bridge network gaps  An Indian telecommunications firm has turned to lasers to help it overcome the problems of setting up voice and data networks in the country.
The Lightpointe laser bridges work over distances of up to 4km and are being used to route both voice and data from businesses on to the backbone of the network.
The laser links also take far less time to set up and get working, said Mr Sridharan.
In places where rain is heavy and fog is common laser links can struggle to maintain good connection speeds.
The laser bridges work across distances up to 4km and can be set up much faster than cable connections.
"It's particularly suitable as the rain rate is a little low and it's hardly ever foggy," he said.
In 12 months the lasers have helped the firm set up networks in more than 700 locations
