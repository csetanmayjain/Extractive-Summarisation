The company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in West Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday and Saturday, bringing along a piece of photo identification.
The company, which makes role playing games such as Knights of the Old Republic and Neverwinter Nights, is seeking people aged 18 to 99.
"The 3D model will look exactly like the person - it's really quite incredible how detailed they are," said Ms Perry.
The Canada-based company says it was looking for "a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters".
Game firm holds 'cast' auditions  Video game firm Bioware is to hold open auditions for people to become cast members for future games.
"There are hundreds and hundreds of characters in a typical Bioware game," said Shauna Perry, Bioware's audio and external resources producer.
"But their face could be used in multiple games - so they could be the hero in one, the villain in another and just a merchant in a third."
Everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performer's fee for the use of their image.
She added: "Not everyone is a model in the world so we don't want just models in our games."
She said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game.
