Allied Domecq's big names include Malibu rum, Courvoisier brandy, Stolichnaya vodka and Ballantine's whisky - as well as snack food chains such as Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins ice cream.
Pernod takeover talk lifts Domecq  Shares in UK drinks and food firm Allied Domecq have risen on speculation that it could be the target of a takeover by France's Pernod Ricard.
Pernod's last major purchase was a third of US giant Seagram in 2000, the move which propelled it into the global top three of drinks firms.
Last year Pernod tried to buy Glenmorangie, one of Scotland's premier whisky firms, but lost out to luxury goods firm LVMH.
Reports in the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times suggested that the French spirits firm is considering a bid, but has yet to contact its target.
Pernod has reduced the debt it took on to fund the Seagram purchase to just 1.8bn euros, while Allied has improved the performance of its fast-food chains.
Pernod is home to brands including Chivas Regal Scotch whisky, Havana Club rum and Jacob's Creek wine.
In terms of market value, Pernod - at 7.5bn euros ($9.7bn) - is about 9% smaller than Allied Domecq, which has a capitalisation of Â£5.7bn ($10.7bn; 8.2bn euros).
The WSJ said that the two were ripe for consolidation, having each dealt with problematic parts of their portfolio.
Allied Domecq shares in London rose 4% by 1200 GMT, while Pernod shares in Paris slipped 1.2%.
